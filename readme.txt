This repository was created to share the code and dataset used to produce the results in the paper "Ring-Like Calorimeter Information for Energy Calibration in Electron Trigger at a Highly Segmented Detector using Gradient Boosted Decision Trees", submitted to JINST.

A simulated Root file is available at this address:

https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/aIQhET482Elcq1u

A Python notebook code example to read the main information from the Root file and make it available for BDT training is found in this folder ("File_Load_Example.ipynb").
